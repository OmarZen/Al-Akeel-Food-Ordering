# Al-Akeel Food Ordering Platform

## Introduction

Al-Akeel Company has developed an online order management platform over the past 15 Years. This platform allows users to make online orders to a specific restaurant from a registered restaurant list. It also tracks and delivers such orders from the restaurant's locations to the customer. The platform serves clients from either a dedicated mobile application, web app, or assisted from customer service over the phone. The platform allows restaurant staff to manage their restaurant-specific orders. The platform integrates with Bank Misr as a payment gateway to fulfill online payments for orders. The platform integrates with Aramex shipment company to manage the delivery of orders. Recently, the company started to face a set of issues, mainly reliability issues where sometimes the platform reported to be down. It suffers from slow responses. They also faced a huge challenge when they needed to support mobile payment as well as support Al-Akeel specific shipment fleet to work side by side with the existing Aramex shipment.
